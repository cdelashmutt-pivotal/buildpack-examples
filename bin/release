# The release script provides feedback metadata back to Cloud Foundry 
# indicating how the application should be executed. The script is run with 
# one argument, the build location of the application. The script must 
# generate a YAML file in the following format:
#
#  config_vars:
#    name: value
#  default_process_types:
#    web: commandLine
#
# Where config_vars is an optional set of environment variables that will be 
# defined in the environment in which the application is executed. 
# default_process_types indicates the type of application being run and the 
# command line used to start it. At this time only web type of applications 
# are supported.

print 'config_vars:'
print '  MY_ENV_VAR: myValue'
